# LLM-final

The code for my model is in `BugFixer.ipynb` and my report is in `LLM Report.pdf`. In order to test the model without redoing the fine-tuning, go to [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ex0mXdu2zlzXU9oNR2pct571P7X25cLc/view?usp=sharing) and download `bugfixer-finetuned.zip`. Unzip the file into the directory with the rest of the files and run cell 3.4 in the notebook to load the most recent version of my fine-tuned model. My answers to exercise 1.1 can be found in the file `1-1.md`.
