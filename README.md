The code for my model is in `BugFixer.ipynb` and my report is in `LLM Report.pdf`. In order to test the model without redoing the fine-tuning, unzip `bugfixer-finetuned.zip` and run cell 3.4 in the notebook to load the most recent one I trained. My answers to exercise 1.1 can be found in the file `1-1.md`.
